TIC-TAC-TOE and War Applications

An early test in user input, hashsets, and logic. I created a tic tac toe game with updating graphics, and an automated War game between two bot players that shuffles and deals the cards, shows each round of play,tracks scores, and displays a winning message to whichever bot has the highest score at the end of the game. The War game also makes use of multiple classes.

Run TicTacToe.java for Tic Tac Toe, ad App.java for War.
